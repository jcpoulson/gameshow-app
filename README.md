# gameshow-app
This project is simply a hangman like game but is built to make the user feel like they are participating in an interactive tv-like game show. This project also uses advanced object oriented programming concepts such as classes and methods to add the logic and life to the game interface.

This Project adds few things to make the style unique. First it makes the whole entire background black and the color of the text almost making of dark mode of this game. Second is that the keys are made black but are given random RGB color borders to mimic an RGB lightup keyboard that video gamers or anyone who builds their own computer would use.
